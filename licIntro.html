            <p>The first 150 years were marked mostly by turbulent economic conditions. It witnessed India's First War of Independence, adverse effects of the World War I and World War II on the economy of India, and in between them the period of worldwide economic crises triggered by the Great depression. The first half of the 20th century saw a heightened struggle for India's independence. The aggregate effect of these events led to a high rate of and liquidation of life insurance companies in India. This had adversely affected the faith of the general in the utility of obtaining life cover.</p>

                    <p>In 1955, parliamentarian Feroz Gandhi raised the matter of insurance fraud by owners of private insurance agencies. In the ensuing investigations, one of India's wealthiest businessmen, Ramkrishna Dalmia, owner of the Times of India newspaper, was sent to prison for two years.</p>
                    <p>The Parliament of India passed the Life Insurance of India Act on 19 June 1956 creating the Life Insurance Corporation of India, which started operating in September of that year. It consolidated the business of 245 private life insurers and other entities offering life insurance services; this consisted of 154 life insurance companies, 16 foreign companies and 75 provident companies. The nationalization of the life insurance business in India was a result of the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956, which had created a policy framework for extending state control over at least 17 sectors of the economy, including life insurance.</p>

            <h2>Liberalisation post 2000s</h2>
            <p>In August 2000, the Indian Government embarked on a program to liberalise the insurance sector and opened it up for the private sector. LIC emerged as a beneficiary from this process with robust performance, albeit on a base substantially higher than the private sector.</p>
            <p>In 2013 the first year premium compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 24.53% while total life premium CAGR was 19.28% matching the growth of the life insurance industry and outperforming general economic growth.</p>

            <p>LIC's slogan yogakshemam vahamyaham is in Sanskrit which loosely translates into English as "Your welfare is our responsibility". This is derived from ancient Hindu text, the Bhagavad Gita's 9th chapter, 22nd. The slogan can be seen in the logo, written in Devanagari script. This line means "I carry what they lack, and I preserve what they have" (refers to Krishna speaking to Arjuna), when taken in context of the entire verse.</p>

            <p>Individually, LIC is estimated to have sold shares worth ₹500-1,000 crore in each of Mahindra & Mahindra, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Tata Motors, L&T, HDFC, Wipro, SBI, Maruti Suzuki, Dr Reddys and Bajaj Auto.</p>
            <p>The insurance behemoth also trimmed holdings in Ambuja Cements, Cipla, TCS, Lupin and Asian Paints. A marginal decline was also witnessed in its stakes in companies such as IDFC, Hindustan Unilever, Grasim, ACC, BPCL, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Sun Pharma and Tata Power.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, LIC further ramped up its stake in a total of 14 Nifty constituents with purchase of shares worth an estimated ₹4,000 crore.</p>
            <p>The major companies where LIC has raised its stake include Infosys, RIL, Coal India Ltd and Cairn India. Other such companies are ITC, Power Grid Corp, NTPC, Siemens, Bharti Airtel and Hero MotoCorp.</p>
            <p>The state-run insurer also marginally hiked its exposure in Ultratech, Gail India, Ranbaxy, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HCL Technologies, while its shareholding remained almost unchanged in companies like ONGC, Tata Steel, BHEL and Reliance Infra.</p>
            <p>Among the Nifty companies, LIC's holding in terms of value in 2012 were estimated to be the highest in ITC (₹27,326 crore), followed by RIL (₹21,659 crore), ONGC (₹17,764 crore), SBI (₹17,058 crore), L&T (₹16,800 crore), and ICICI Bank (₹10,006 crore).</p>
            <p>The share price drop in ITC on 18 July 2017 had caused LIC a major loss of around 7000 Crores.</p>
            <p>LIC now also holds 51% stake in IDBI bank thus making it the only insurer in India to own a bank, since regulations prohibit insurers from holding more than 15% stake in any company, LIC will have to decide a timeline for paring its stake in IDBI bank; also LIC will have to pare its stake in LIC Housing Finance Ltd as a company cannot be promoter of 2 finance companies carrying out same housing finance business so either LIC has to sell its stake in LIC housing or close down housing business of IDBI bank. </p>
